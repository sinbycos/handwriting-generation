# handwriting-generation

Train a LSTM and MDN network to generate handwriting both unconditionally and conditionally based on text input. This code is based on [Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf).


## How do I run it?

Run the jupyter notebook in Docker:

* `source run_docker.sh`


Or run it locally:

* `source run_local.sh`


## Results

The results can be run in a jupyter notebook using `./run_docker.sh` or `./run_local.sh` . In addition PyCharm can also be used.



## Training

Specify the data and model directories in the setup.py file:
